# TextAnalyser
This is an example of my work.
Commented out are the sections of code that would require the main data file which is 1 GB in size.
Due to the issues of including that, I have disabled those functionalities.
Remaining is the ability to load a file in the same way as would normally be used by the program, display the contents of the file as they are stored, and find the keywords in the file.
With the large data file, you would also be able to determine how words relate to one onother, including how a word would relate to the file as a whole.
This data file holds information on 400,000 'words' and their relationships, hence the large filesize.
On my laptop comparing a word to a whole file would typically take around one minute.

Some example .txt files are included in the debug folder (the default folder), these are:
BBC - a copy and paste into notepad of the frontpage of the BBC some time ago
Brain - the wikipedia article on the human brain
GW-1 - the wikipedia article on global warming
Test - an assortment of text I initially wrote to test the loading and displaying of text files
WW2-1 - the wikipedia article on world war 2

Feel free to include any txt file you choose as well, those are there as examples.
